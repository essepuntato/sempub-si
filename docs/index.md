## Special Issue on Semantic Publishing

The use of Web and Semantic Web technologies for making published entities such as articles and scientific data easier to discover, browse and interact with, is referred by researchers in the field using the name *Semantic Publishing*[^1]. This movement has actively involved researchers from both academia and industry, including publishers (e.g. [Springer Nature](https://springernature.com/), [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/) and [F1000](https://f1000.com/)), institutions for the assessment of the quality of research (e.g. the [Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes](http://www.anvur.org)), and broad academic communities such as [Force11](https://www.force11.org/) and [Linked Research](https://linkedresearch.org/), all united in the goal of changing and improving the current practices of research communication.
